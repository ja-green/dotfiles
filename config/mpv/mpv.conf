# mpv config

# configuration files are read system-wide from /usr/local/etc/mpv.conf
# and per-user from ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf, where per-user settings override
# system-wide settings, all of which are overridden by the command line
#
# configuration file settings and the command line options use the same
# underlying mechanisms. most options can be put into the configuration file
# by dropping the preceding '--'. See the man page for a complete list of
# options
#
# lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored
#
# see the CONFIGURATION FILES section in the man page
# for a detailed description of the syntax
#
# profiles should be placed at the bottom of the configuration file to ensure
# that settings wanted as defaults are not restricted to specific profiles

# ipc
input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpv.sock

# disable on screen controller
